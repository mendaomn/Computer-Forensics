Write a script that, using SleuthKit, checks all the sector slack at the end of each file in a ext3 partition and dumps the ones that contain data.

Requirements:
self-contained python script that either use the SleuthKit bindingins or invoke it as a subprocess
the tool should check all file in a filesystem specified as parameter
shows a progress bar to tell the user the percentage of files analyzed so far
for each file that has data in the slack space, create a file in a subdirectory named with the inode number and containing the slack bytes
